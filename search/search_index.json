There is absolutely no cost and we promise not to hassle you with too many reminders - you can opt out at any point.</p> <p>When reviewing archetypes, remember that these are not 'forms' as such - they are definitions of the information that sits beneath, so don't worry about the exact appearance.</p>"}]}
